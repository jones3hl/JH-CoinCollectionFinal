   <p>The Central Bank of The Bahamas has recently released a new version of their 100 dollar banknote. The new bill came into circulation in October of 2021. Arthur Dion Hanna is featured on the bill and he's known as former Governor General, former Deputy Prime Minister, and a former Minister of Finance of the Commonwealth of The Bahamas. This new design incorporates easily identifiable security enhancements to promote continued public confidence in banknotes.</p>

         <h3>Buffalo Nickel</h3>
         <p>This is also known as the Indian Head nickel as one side has a buffalo and the other an American Indian in profile.  The coins were minted from 1913 to 1938. It was not popular with one company which manufactured the insides of coin operated vending machines because they were having a difficult time trying to distinguish between the nickel and a slug.  Additionally the coin was redesigned as soon as the minimum 25 year run had completed because the dates were wearing off the nickels very quickly.</p>

         <h3>Wisconsin Error Quarter</h3>
         <p>Sometimes when printing coins, errors can occur that increase the value of these coins. An error can have many different meanings and often multiple can appear on a single coin. In this example, we can see in the circle how an extra leaf got imprinted on this design. Normally, there would only be the two large leaves stemming from the corn husk. This coin appears to have three leaves total, meaning an error happened during the pressing process.</p>

         <h3>Wheat Penny</h3>
         <p>This is a version of the Lincoln cent that was minted from 1909 to 1958 and had a depiction of wheat on the back of the coin.  Interestingly, the cent was the first US coin to depict an actual person.  Up until this time all coins featured an allegorical figure for Liberty, usually female.  The start date for this coin coincided nicely with the 100 year anniversary of Lincolnâ€™s assassination.</p>
